--  it is not supported in SQLite.
-- It works cobining with the inner join invoices that has production and not production hours,
--  than the first union prodvides invoices with production hours only selecting all recoords that are not in the non production table.
--  The second union provides invoices with non production hours, exluding records that are in the production table.
